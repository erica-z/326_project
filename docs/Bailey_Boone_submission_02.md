I honestly did not do very much to contribute to our Project 2 submission. I missed a bunch of lectures and therefore wasn't able to aid in the configuration of the Django application or the mock data, and was not a part of the templates and views development.

The contributions I did make were mostly abstract: I helped design the data model back in Project 1 and reiterated the same design to my group members during development, and aided designing of the users and actions. I also fixed little bugs such as a redirect error found after posting a new event to the application.

I'm hoping to be able to provide much better support to my team when it comes time for queries and working directly with the database in our application, as I have practical experience working in that area from internships.
