Submission 03 Individual Write Up

Based on the example from the lecture slides, I wrote login.html and added login redirect in settings.py. I also created sign-up functionality by implementing a user sign up form, a sign up view, a sign up button, and a sign up url in corresponding files. 

In addition, I extended Django's user model to our PetUser model to fully take advantage of Django's user authentication features. I also adjusted the settings accordingly and modified the various files that import PetUser.

Lastly, I added two functionalities to the website: view user profile and edit user profile. Add-Pet wasn't working and I was able to modify the view and added in a form to fix it.
