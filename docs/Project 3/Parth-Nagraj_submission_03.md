I contributed to several aspects of this project.
1. I helped make it so that the events, pets, and profile information of the logged in user is displayed
2. I helped with editing init.py so that the group PetOwner is programmatically created with the intended permissions 
3. I helped with Creating the forms so that Pets and Events can be added
4. Made the submission video
