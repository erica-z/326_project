I contributed to several aspects of this project.
1. I edited init.py so that the group PetOwner is programmatically created with the intended permissions and the generated users are added to the group
2. I made it so that the events, pets, and profile information of the logged in user is displayed
3. The user is locked out of the website if they're not logged in
4. Created the forms so that Pets and Events can be added
5. Wrote submission_03.md
