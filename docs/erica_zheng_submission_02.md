I contributed to several aspects of this project. Based on the initial data model diagram draft that our team has agreed upon, I implemented the data model entities in models.py.

In addition, I registered the models in admin.py and wrote the migration script in init.sh. Our team was struggling with creating images for our mock data part of the assignment, after considerable trial and error, I was finally able to create an array of images for our objects to randomly select from.  

Lastly, I revised the data model diagram that our team had agreed upon based on our implementation of the data models and typed up the digital version. I also wrote the design overview in the team write up and talked about the data model in the video.
