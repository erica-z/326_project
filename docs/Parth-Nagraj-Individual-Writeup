I contributed to many aspects of this project. To start off I have been able to delegate tasks to members of my team so that we are able to get the project done in a timely manner.  I had many of my own tasks that I had to complete. 

For back-end, I helped implement the Django framework for the Catch, helped create a functioning admin site. With the help of team members, I helped create the final data model diagram.  We were cycling through a lot of ideas and we finally decided on making it 3 databases consisting of their separate attributes. I have helped with implementing the Pet, User and the Event data models in models.py with their individual attributes. We initially had it set up that we wanted a 4th image database but we added that object to the other 3 data models.  I helped implement the views.py and url.py so that all the pages are mapped correctly. Using bootstrap implementing the navigation bar,  helped in displaying the mock events on the eventsPage, homePage, mapPage.    

For the front-end, I added the 4 tabs to the home page: hosting, going, interested, following so that we can filter events in the future. I made a temporary logo for the site so that we can reference it later and make a better one. I made the bare bones of the navigation bar as well as helped create the other tabs and how the look and feel of the site should be. 

I did most of the submission video as well as the editing. I as well helped create the write-up.
