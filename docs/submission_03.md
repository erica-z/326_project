# Design Overview:
Users can now only view the page when logged in. Being logged in displays the events that the user is hosting under the Events tab. Being logged in displays the pets that the user owns under the Pets tab. Being logged in allows the user to edit their profile information.


# Problems/Successes:

Problems:
* Getting an image associated with the admin user
* Assigning encrypted passwords with init.py
* Programatically creating a group and assigning permissions


Success: 
* Displaying events and pets based on the logged in user
* Forms that allow user to create pets and events
* Form that allows user to edit their profile

# Team Choice:
Using the Google maps API to embed a realtime map with a marker where the user currently is and markers of nearby events currently going on.
